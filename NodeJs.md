## What is NPM
* Many companies use NPM to manage private development
* Another package manager, like npm, that we can use to install third-party modules and external libraries is called YARN (Yet Another Resource Navigator) package manager

# YARN
* Yet Another Resource Navigator
* NPM is a prerequisite for installing YARN, and you need to use this command to install YARN
* npm install yarn -global
* YARN generates a 'yarn.lock' file.
* YARN add command logs are brief and much cleaner. They are ordered in the form of a tree. An image of it is attached on the next slide
* To install a package in YARN, we use the command given below





# NPM
* It is the default package manager
* You need not install npm; it is included in the Node.js installer
* The npm generates a package-json.lock file

# YARN
* Unlike npm, it is not the default package manager
* To install YARN, npm needs to be installed
* YARN generates a yarn.lock file

# MODULES, DEPENDENCIES AND PACKAGES
*Terms commonly used in Node.js:*

### Modules

### Dependencies 
are requirements that you need to use an API or a function that is part of an internal module then for that you need that module as a dependency
